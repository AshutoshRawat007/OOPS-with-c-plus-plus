Task 01 {
Given -- creating 2 methods with different namespaces 
         one takes integer and other float
         both returns sum.

Result--using scope resolution operator its solved ex.( first::add(10,20);   second::add(5.1,2.2);    )

} Task 01 end .



Task 02{
Given --  using both namespaces in header created in Task 01 .
          call add method without scope resoltuion operator .


Result--add(10,20) id ok but  add(5.1,2.2) giver add(double ,double) is ambiguos ..compiler treats 5.1 as a double and there aint function with double

Solution-- so to solve this error declare number with suffix 
            { 5.1f } so compiler knows its float and can reach the function with float argument.
            Fn overloading!!!!

}  Task 02 End
