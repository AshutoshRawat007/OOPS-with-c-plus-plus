Task 1 {
        string + int ;
        error --> mismatch types // no match for + operator
        reason--> in string class '+' is only defined for string + string as a concatenation function     hence the error as it cant convert int to string
        
        }
       
       
Task 2 {
        check for palindrome;
        
        sol--> just iterate string from reverse and compare it orgnal string which iterated forward
        }
        
Task 3 {
        reverse string using reverse function and then manually 
        status--> done 
        }
Task 4 {
        compare strings manually;
        sol--> to compare manually 
                1.check for there length sizes if different then not equal obviously
                2.if length = then iteratre forward and check subtract [charcter of b from a] and type cast to int
       }
       
Task 5 {
        use compare function;
        }
Task 6 {
        check if string in c++ are mutable;
        sol--> yes they are mutable to prove print address of orignal string then maked changes to it then again print address -- they will be same
        }
